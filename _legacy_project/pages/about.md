# About

This project extends Evidence's core open source by adding the ability for end users to add commentary to reports.

This functionality is provided via an [AirTable](https://www.airtable.com/), which stores the commentary and allows users to edit it.

The code for this project is on [GitHub](https://github.com/evidence-dev/business-reviews-demo).

## Authentication

- You cannot save edits to the commentary unless you have the (secret) password.
- In most organizational settings, this would be handled instead by user authentication, but for the purposes of this public demo, we're using a password.
- Evidence offers authentication through [Evidence Cloud](https://du3tapwtcbi.typeform.com/to/kwp7ZD3q), our hosted cloud service.
